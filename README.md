# Dataset repository template

Use this repository as a starting point for a dataset held in GitHub and discoverable through a data portal. It includes a [Data Package 2.0](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/) descriptor and a clearly marked placeholder resource. **Replace all example metadata and `input.csv` before publishing or releasing a dataset.** The repository is the source of its data; the portal is a reviewed catalogue, not a copy of the files.

## Create a dataset repository

1. In GitHub, choose **Use this template → Create a new repository**. A suggested name is `ds-<task>-<user>` (lowercase, hyphen-separated), e.g. `ds-transcription-annotator01`. Avoid personal names or sensitive identifiers in public repository names.
2. Choose repository visibility deliberately. A public catalogue record does not grant access to a private repository. Check consent, permissions, licensing, and file size before adding data.
3. Replace the package `name` with a stable lowercase identifier and `title` with the human-readable dataset title. Update `description` and subject `keywords` in `datapackage.json`. Replace the `created` example with the accurate RFC 3339 date-time for this package/data, or remove it if unknown; do not reuse the template's placeholder date. Replace the contributor example with the actual person or organization and their Data Package contributor roles, or remove it if unknown. Only add `licenses` or raw `sources` when accurate and safe to publish.
4. Replace `input.csv` with the real resource, or remove it and update `resources` to list the real files. Resource paths are relative to the repository root; organize files in any folders and list each resource in `datapackage.json`. Do not leave the placeholder row in a real dataset.
5. Document provenance, selection criteria, annotation methods, ownership/contact, access terms, status, and how to use the data in this README. Share only details safe for the repository's audience.
6. With Node.js 22+, run `node --test scripts/*.test.mjs` and `node scripts/validate-datapackage.mjs`. No dependency installation is needed. The GitHub Action repeats these checks on pull requests targeting `main` and pushes to `main`; it can also be run manually.

## Data Package descriptor

`datapackage.json` follows the Data Package 2.0 descriptor profile. `name` is the stable machine-readable identifier; `title` is the human label. `resources` is required and lists one or more local data resources by unique name and repository-relative path. Resource paths must resolve to files inside the repository. The validator checks the descriptor fields used by this template and the existence and safety of local resource paths; it is not a complete implementation of every Data Package rule and does not inspect file contents or determine whether data is safe to publish.

New dataset repositories use `datapackage.json` as their metadata input. The portal's GitHub onboarding maps package `title` to its catalogue display name and derives publisher and repository links from GitHub. A public repository may have its resources linked from the catalogue after a release and human review; the portal does not copy resource bytes. A restricted repository contributes only safe metadata and a credential-free landing-page link to the public catalogue; its resource paths and files must not be exposed there. Nothing in this template automatically publishes a catalogue record.

## Releasing this template or a dataset repository

The copied `release.yml` workflow works in each repository. After `Validate metadata` succeeds on a push to `main`, Release Please uses Conventional Commits to open or update a version and `CHANGELOG.md` release PR when a version bump is warranted. Review that PR and merge it to create the version tag and GitHub Release. Ordinary feature merges do not publish immediately; docs/chore-only changes normally do not warrant a bump. Release management ignores PR CI, failed CI, stale results, and tag pushes.

A new repository starts at `0.1.0` on its first release. When creating a dataset repository from this template, reset `.release-please-manifest.json` to `{}` and remove any inherited `CHANGELOG.md` before its first release so it does not inherit the template's release version or history.

Use squash merges with Conventional Commit PR titles: `feat(data): add annotated pages` (minor), `fix(data): correct labels` (patch), or `feat(data)!: change the annotation schema` / a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (major). Release Please manages the version and changelog; do not manually edit its generated release files. A release tag records a snapshot; catalogue publication is a separate human-reviewed decision.

Before enabling releases in each repository:

1. Treat `main` as reviewed, releasable data. Require PRs and the metadata validation check; restrict direct pushes to `main`. The workflow responds to successful pushes to `main`, not just PR merges. It requests Contents, Issues, and Pull requests write permissions for its built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests in **Settings → Actions → General** if repository policy requires it. No extra secret is needed.
2. Review visibility, consent, and access restrictions. GitHub automatically offers source archives of tagged repositories; tracked data files may be included and made public with a public repository. Keep commit subjects and release descriptions free of private information.
3. Review each generated release PR. Because it is opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, GitHub does not automatically run `Validate metadata` on that PR. Manually run **Validate metadata** on its branch and inspect the diff and result before merging. Re-run validation if Release Please updates the branch, and confirm manual validation satisfies required-check rules.
